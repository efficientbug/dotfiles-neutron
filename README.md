Personal dotfiles for neutron managed by [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Notes

Some things to keep in mind when using the code from this repository:

* Most of the files and code are documented even in some cases where the comments might seem really obvious, but that's intentional due to the nature of configuration options usually being the *set and forget* kind.
* Some files aren't included in this repository, most likely because of containing credentials, in these cases a `*.template` file is included in the same path with the same name and structure of the original.
